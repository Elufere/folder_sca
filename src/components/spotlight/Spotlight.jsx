                The Spotlight and Wardrobe Showcase is a premium service designed to increase the visibility of your listings on our peer-to-peer e-commerce platform. By subscribing, your products will be highlighted to reach a broader audience, potentially increasing sales. This policy outlines the terms and conditions associated with the Spotlight Subscription.

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                When a seller subscribes to the Spotlight service, their listings are given priority in search results and category pages. This means that when a buyer searches for a product or browses a category related to the spotlighted item, those items are displayed at the top or in special sections, making them more likely to be seen.
